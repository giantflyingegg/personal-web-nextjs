          WW3WS is a weekly meetup dedicated to the Web3 space. Founded in 2022 by
          James Zaki, a developer with the Ethereum Foundation, our weekly meetups
          serve as a platform for talented individuals to share innovation,
          discussion, and exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          While our roots lie in the Ethereum ecosystem, we also explore the
          broader crypto universe, tackling topics that range from the latest
          technological advancements to the economic, sociological, and
          philosophical underpinnings of this digital revolution.
